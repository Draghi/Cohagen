Cohagen is a small games engine written in C using OpenGL and GLFW3, it was created as a university project.

It features the following:
  - A psudeo-object oriented style.
  - An OpenGL 3.3 rendering system
  - A gameloop manger with a variable fixed timestep.
  - Matrix and vector math utilities
  - A basic mipmap loader
  - A basic particle physics system
  - Collision detection and response

Controls:
  - Mouse to look
  - WASD to move
  - QE to speed up/slow down
  - Space to go up
  - Shift to go down
  - [ and ] to change the mass of the next gravity well
  - L-Click to place a gravity well
  - R-Click to place an anti-gravity well
